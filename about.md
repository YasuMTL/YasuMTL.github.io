I have worked in a POS system company as a programmer for 1 year and 5 months. I was using mainly C++ and Delphi to maintain and troubleshooting bugs of the POS system. I was also assigned for 6 months to a side project of an Android app which enables you to proceed transactions such as payment, refund or void with the help of Clover API.

Apart from that, here are my own apps on Play Store and the detail available on GitHub :
