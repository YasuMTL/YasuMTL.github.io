While I was struggling to creat this blog, I got familir with 4 basic Git commands below.

| Command       | Effect        |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| git add .     | Put all the modified files in the current folder on the stage, meaning that get those files ready to be commited.  |
| git status    | See all the files name which were added by the "git add ." command      |
| git commit -m "Commit Message" | Save on the current branch the changes added by the "git add ." command      |
| git push      | Upload the changes to a remote repository      |
